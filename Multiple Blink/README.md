This folder contains two files that shows how to multi blink two LEDs from an MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529 development board. The MSP430G2553 c.file is named multiblink1.c and the MSP430F5529 c.file is named multiblink2.c. In these files, each microcontroller has it specific pins that output the signals to turn on the both LEDs but are set at different delay cycles.
