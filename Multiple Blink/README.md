This folder contains two files that shows how to multi blink one LED from an MSP430G2553 and MSP430FR2311 development board. The MSP430G2553 c.file is named blinky1.c and the MSP430FR2311 c.file is named blinky2.c. In these files, each microcontroller has it specific pins that output the signal to turn on the LED but are set at different delay cycles.
